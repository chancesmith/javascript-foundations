# Data Types

In JavaScript, there are 7 different kinds of data you can use you your software.

See examples in `examples.ts`;

## 1 - Number 🧮

A number, including numbers with decimals: 2, 3, 6512, 3.1415.

## 2 - String 📝

Any set of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) wrapped by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". In this workshop we'll use single quotes. String is a fancy word for text.

## 3 - Boolean ✅

This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.

## 4 - Object 🚙

Collections of related data.

## 5 - Null 😑

This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).

## 6 - Undefined 📭

This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.

## 7 - Symbol 👶

A newer feature to JavaScript, symbols are unique identifiers. We won't worry about that now.

## TODO

Jump in `script.js` and follow the comments.
